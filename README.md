# Private Chat List

**This extension hides/reveals chat list content with a click of a button.**

Once you (manually) install this extension and reload *https://whatsapp.com*, you will see a **new button** on the top bar.
Once you press the "secret button", all chats in the chat list will switch to **"hidden" mode**.

**"Hidden" mode** sets a certain opaque value on all chats. 
On hover however, the hovered chat-box will come back to full opacity, except for the latest text message (which is shown on every chat-box) which will be visible only when hovering specificity on it.
